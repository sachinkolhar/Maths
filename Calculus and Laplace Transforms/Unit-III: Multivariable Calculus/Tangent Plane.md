Substitute the values:

6(x - 3) + 8(y - 4) + 0(z - 0) = 0

**5. Simplify the Equation:**

6x - 18 + 8y - 32 + 0 = 0

6x + 8y - 50 = 0

Divide by 2:

3x + 4y - 25 = 0

**Final Answer:**

The equation of the tangent plane to the sphere x² + y² + z² = 25 at the point (3, 4, 0) is **3x + 4y - 25 = 0**.

## 7  find the tangent plane to the surface z = f(x, y) = xy + y² at the point (1, 2) and then check if it's parallel to the plane x - 2y + z = 5.

**1. Find the Value of z at (1, 2):**

z = f(1, 2) = (1)(2) + (2)² = 2 + 4 = 6

So the point is (1, 2, 6).

**2. Find the Partial Derivatives:**

* ∂f/∂x = y
* ∂f/∂y = x + 2y

**3. Evaluate the Partial Derivatives at the Point (1, 2):**

* ∂f/∂x (1, 2) = 2
* ∂f/∂y (1, 2) = 1 + 2(2) = 5

**4. Use the Tangent Plane Equation:**

The equation of the tangent plane at (x₀, y₀, z₀) is given by:

z - z₀ = ∂f/∂x (x₀, y₀) (x - x₀) + ∂f/∂y (x₀, y₀) (y - y₀)

Substitute the values:

z - 6 = 2(x - 1) + 5(y - 2)

**5. Simplify the Equation:**

z - 6 = 2x - 2 + 5y - 10

z - 6 = 2x + 5y - 12

z = 2x + 5y - 6

Rearrange:

2x + 5y - z - 6 = 0

**6. Check for Parallelism:**

The given plane is x - 2y + z = 5, which can be written as x - 2y + z - 5 = 0.

Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are proportional.

* Normal vector of the tangent plane: <2, 5, -1>
* Normal vector of the given plane: <1, -2, 1>

Let's check if they are proportional:

* 2/1 ≠ 5/-2 ≠ -1/1

Since the ratios are not equal, the normal vectors are not proportional.

**Final Answer:**

* The equation of the tangent plane is **2x + 5y - z - 6 = 0**.
* The tangent plane is **not parallel** to the plane x - 2y + z = 5.
