## 4) find the Taylor series expansion of log(cos(x)) around x = π/3 up to the 4th term.

**1. Find the Function Value and Derivatives at x = π/3:**

* **f(x) = log(cos(x))**
   * f(π/3) = log(cos(π/3)) = log(1/2) = -log(2)

* **f'(x) = -sin(x)/cos(x) = -tan(x)**
   * f'(π/3) = -tan(π/3) = -√3

* **f''(x) = -sec²(x)**
   * f''(π/3) = -sec²(π/3) = -(2)² = -4

* **f'''(x) = -2sec(x) * sec(x)tan(x) = -2sec²(x)tan(x)**
   * f'''(π/3) = -2sec²(π/3)tan(π/3) = -2(4)(√3) = -8√3

* **f''''(x) = -2 [2sec²(x)tan²(x) + sec⁴(x)]**
   * f''''(π/3) = -2 [2(4)(3) + 16] = -2 [24 + 16] = -80

**2. Taylor Series Formula:**

The Taylor series expansion of f(x) around x = a is:

f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)(x-a)²/2! + f'''(a)(x-a)³/3! + f''''(a)(x-a)⁴/4! + ...

**3. Substitute the Values:**

In our case, a = π/3.

f(x) = -log(2) - √3(x - π/3) - 4(x - π/3)²/2 - 8√3(x - π/3)³/6 - 80(x - π/3)⁴/24 + ...

**4. Simplify:**

f(x) = -log(2) - √3(x - π/3) - 2(x - π/3)² - (4√3/3)(x - π/3)³ - (10/3)(x - π/3)⁴ + ...

**Therefore, the Taylor series expansion of log(cos(x)) around x = π/3 up to the 4th term is:**

**f(x) = -log(2) - √3(x - π/3) - 2(x - π/3)² - (4√3/3)(x - π/3)³ - (10/3)(x - π/3)⁴**

Let's find the Taylor series expansion of tan(x) around x = π/4 up to the 3rd term.

**1. Find the Function Value and Derivatives at x = π/4:**

* **f(x) = tan(x)**
   * f(π/4) = tan(π/4) = 1

* **f'(x) = sec²(x)**
   * f'(π/4) = sec²(π/4) = (√2)² = 2

* **f''(x) = 2sec(x) * sec(x)tan(x) = 2sec²(x)tan(x)**
   * f''(π/4) = 2sec²(π/4)tan(π/4) = 2(2)(1) = 4

* **f'''(x) = 2[2sec²(x)tan²(x) + sec⁴(x)]**
   * f'''(π/4) = 2[2(2)(1) + (2)²] = 2[4 + 4] = 16

**2. Taylor Series Formula:**

The Taylor series expansion of f(x) around x = a is:

f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)(x-a)²/2! + f'''(a)(x-a)³/3! + ...

**3. Substitute the Values:**

In our case, a = π/4.

f(x) = 1 + 2(x - π/4) + 4(x - π/4)²/2 + 16(x - π/4)³/6 + ...

**4. Simplify:**

f(x) = 1 + 2(x - π/4) + 2(x - π/4)² + (8/3)(x - π/4)³ + ...

**Therefore, the Taylor series expansion of tan(x) around x = π/4 up to the 3rd term is:**

**f(x) = 1 + 2(x - π/4) + 2(x - π/4)² + (8/3)(x - π/4)³**
