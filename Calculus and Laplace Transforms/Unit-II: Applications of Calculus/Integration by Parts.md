∫sin^2(3x)cos(3x)dx <br>

Why ILATE Doesn't Apply Simply:

- ILATE is for Products: The ILATE rule (Inverse trigonometric, Logarithmic, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential) is primarily used for integrals involving the product of two different types of functions. While you have a product of trigonometric functions, the key here is that one is a power of the other (sin 
2(3x) and cos(3x)).
